Hello! I'm Caleb, the creator of this repository. This is the second emulator that I've created, following my [chemu6502](https://github.com/calebhultmann/chemu6502) project.
I've got a deep interest in low-level development and emulation, and this was my way of breaking deeper into that type of development.

To see what else I'm working on, checkout my [homepage](https://github.com/calebhultmann)!
